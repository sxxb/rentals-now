            <h3>1. Book Your Rental</h3>
            <p>
                Contact us to arrange your rental. If you know exactly what you need, simply call, email or use the contact form to set up your rental.
            </p>
            <p> 
                If you need some help deciding which product is best suited to your needs, feel free to contact us with questions and queries, and we will be happy to walk you through your options.</p>
            <p>
                Once you have confirmed your booking dates and product, we will provide a rental agreement to sign. Once your agreement is signed, we will arrange shipment of your rental product.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Receiving Your Rental</h3>
            <p>
                When your booking date nears, your rental will be sent out to you. You will receive tracking information via email and/or SMS. We do not send rental products with "Authority to Leave", which means you will need to be available to receive the rental product.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Using Your Rental</h3>
            <p>
                When your item arrives, your rental term begins. You can begin using your product, within the terms of the rental agreement. This will be provided to you via email when you make your booking, and a hard copy will be provided with your item.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Returning Your Rental</h3>
            <p>
                The day before your rental term ends, you will recieve a shipping label and manifest via email. We will also arrange a courier to pick up the item from the delivery address.
            </p>
            <p>
                The day your rental term ends, please pack your item in the same carton it was delivered in, and affix the shipping label to the carton. Print and sign the manifest, and keep it with the product for the courier.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will receive a notification when the item has been collected. If you miss your collection you may be invoiced for the additional time, so ensure you are organised!
            </p>
            <h3>5. After Your Rental</h3>
            <p>
                Once the item is returned to you, you will receive your deposit back. We always love getting feedback, whether it's about things we did well, or things we could do better - so you will receive a short survey email after your rental term.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, your rental with Rentals Now is complete. Hopefully we will have the opportunity to work with you again.
            </p>
            <p>
